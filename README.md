**Focus**: There is a new character introduced with the release of Chainsaw Man Part 2 Manga. Her name is Asa Mitaka. Goal is to figure out how the Twitter community feels about her.

From [Chainsaw Man wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chainsaw_Man "Chainsaw Man wikipedia") article:
> Chainsaw Man (Japanese: チェンソーマン, Hepburn: Chensō Man) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Tatsuki Fujimoto.

>Chainsaw Man follows the story of Denji, an impoverished young man who after making a contract with a dog-like devil named Pochita, he fuses with Denji, granting him the ability to transform parts of his body into chainsaws. Denji eventually joins the Public Safety Devil Hunters, a government agency focused on fighting against devils whenever they become a threat to the world.

>The second part began serialization on July 13, 2022.
